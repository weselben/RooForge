# Scoped Re-Review Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a re-review after a fix round. The re-reviewer verifies the findings were addressed and checks the fix diff for new breakage. It is not a fresh review — the full review already happened. Dispatch it as a read-only `explore` agent.

**Purpose:** Verify each finding from the previous review was addressed, and that the fix itself broke nothing.

```
You are re-reviewing one task's fix round. A previous review produced
findings; an implementer has attempted to fix them. Your job is to verdict
each finding and inspect the fix diff — nothing else.

## The Task

[TASK_SPEC — the task text the implementer worked from]

## The Findings Under Verification

[FINDINGS]

## The Fix

The implementer's fix report:
[FIX_REPORT — the fix-round return message: what changed, commits, the
covering-test command and output]

**Fix base:** [FIX_BASE_SHA] (the head the previous review saw)
**Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
**Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

Read the diff file once — it contains the fix commits, a stat summary, and
the fix diff with surrounding context. Do not re-run git commands. If the
diff file is missing, fetch the diff yourself:
`git diff --stat [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and
`git diff [FIX_BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.

Your review is read-only. Do not mutate any working tree, index, HEAD, or
branch state in any way.

## Scope

Your scope is the findings list and the fix diff. Verdict every finding.
Inspect the fix diff for new problems the fix itself introduced. Do NOT
re-review code the fix did not touch: if you notice an issue entirely
outside the fix diff, report it under Out-of-Scope Observations — it does
not block this task and does not extend the loop. A broad whole-branch
review happens after all tasks are complete.

## Tests

The implementer re-ran the tests covering the amended code and reported the
command and output. Treat the report as unverified claims: confirm the fix
report names the covering tests and shows their output, and verify the
claims against the diff. Do not re-run the suite to confirm. Run a test
only when reading the code raises a specific doubt no existing run answers
— and then a focused test, never a package-wide suite.

## Output Format

Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the first
finding's verdict. Every line is a verdict, a finding with file:line, or a
check you ran — no preamble, no process narration.

### Finding Verdicts

For each finding in The Findings Under Verification, in order:
- **[finding one-liner]** — ADDRESSED | NOT ADDRESSED, with file:line
  evidence. "Attempted" is not addressed: the specific defect must no
  longer exist.

### New Breakage in the Fix Diff

Anything the fix itself broke or introduced, with severity
(Critical/Important/Minor) and file:line. "None" if clean.

### Out-of-Scope Observations

Issues you noticed entirely outside the fix diff. Non-blocking; the
coordinator defers these to the final review. "None" if none.

### Verdict

**Fix round:** [All findings addressed, no new Critical/Important breakage
| Findings remain open] — list the open ones.
```

**Placeholders:**

- `[TASK_SPEC]` — the task text the implementer worked from
- `[FINDINGS]` — the Critical/Important findings and spec gaps from the
  previous review, copied verbatim, one per bullet
- `[FIX_REPORT]` — the implementer's fix-round return message (what changed,
  commits, covering-test command and output)
- `[FIX_BASE_SHA]` — the head the previous review saw
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — the task branch's current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — the diff file the coordinator generated over the fix
  range (see SKILL.md)

**Re-reviewer returns:** per-finding verdicts (ADDRESSED / NOT ADDRESSED),
new breakage in the fix diff, out-of-scope observations, and a round verdict.
